notepad

The user can go to this website/app and leave notes, however long, title them and insert images into the notes(maybe). The ntoes are saved adn there will be a seperate page wehre thee ntoes can be sorted by creation date and name, maybe by how recently they were opened. The first page will be like a text field, and have a submit button underneath 


                        Database -> Note(content, timeCreated, title, timeEdited, imageScr)

                        API ->
                            /getAllNotes (sort by time of creation)
                            /postNote (given a note object, add it to db)
                            /deleteNote (given the id of the note, delete it)
                            /updateNote (given the id of the note and the new note object, update it)

                        React ->

                        Router
                            /notes
                                -> Notes.js
                                create the state and make the default state contain several notes objects
                                    maps an array of object (from the state)
                                        -> to Note.js

                            /notesForm
                                -> NotesForm.js
                                has a default state and adds a note from the form on submit to the state.


const note = {
    title: "Title 1",
    content: "Amazing trip to Japan",
    timeCreated: DateTime(),
    timeEdited: NaN / DateTime(),
    imageScr: ""

}
